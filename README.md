Secretstore
===========

Choosing a different password for every account is a good practice. While
remembering them is hard, password management systems keep them organized.
However, logging into an account from a different computer than yours might be
challenging since you have no access to the secrets from there.

Secretstore is filling the gap by providing a web interface to your keyrings.


Supported keyrings
------------------

Currently only [Gnome Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring) files are
supported. There is a
[plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-keyring-integration/)
that allows Gnome Keyring integration with Firefox.
